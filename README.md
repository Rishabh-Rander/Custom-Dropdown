# Custom Dropdown Menu

This project is a custom dropdown menu component that allows users to select an item from a list of options. The dropdown displays a placeholder text when no item is selected, shows all options when opened, and highlights the selected item when chosen.
This project was inspired by Roadmap.sh's [Custom Dropdown](https://roadmap.sh/projects/custom-dropdown).

## Features

- **Default State**: Displays a placeholder text when no option is selected.
- **Open State**: Reveals all available options when the dropdown is clicked.
- **Selected State**: Highlights the chosen item and displays it in the dropdown.
- **Auto-Close**: The dropdown menu closes upon selection of an item.
